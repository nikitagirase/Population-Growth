# Population-Growth

Introduction: 
The overcrowded population and rapid rise of human civilisation are its fundamental problems. Many organisations are struggling to review their annual finished report in a difficult way for the sake of their continued existence in this world.
Numerous organisations, including the World Resources Institute, the World Bank, UNEP, and UNDP, have been working hard to estimate the present world population in a variety of ways.
We may thus use this programme to determine whether the population has risen in recent years.
